# CryptoLoan

## Overview
This application is a decentralized solution that allows users to deposit JAY Coin as collateral and borrow Ethereum (ETH) from the blockchain. By utilizing smart contract technology, the platform ensures security, transparency, and efficiency in lending and borrowing.

When users deposit JAY Coins, these assets are locked in a smart contract until the Ethereum loan is repaid. This allows users to retain their JAY Coin holdings while unlocking liquidity in ETH, which can be used for trading, staking, or other blockchain-related activities. With low fees, customizable loan durations, and a user-friendly interface, the platform simplifies the entire process of obtaining Ethereum through collateralized loans.
